# OpticalEngineeringSlides
Slides to support a curriculum to teach image processing, optical engineering, and research skills to undergraduate students majoring in biology and biochemistry. Image processing is taught with Python and OpenCV. A microprocessor-based lensless holographic microscope provides hands-on experience with optical engineering.
